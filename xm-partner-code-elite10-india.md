# XM Partner Code ELITE10 – Bonus, Rebate, and IB Program for Traders in India

XM Partner Code ELITE10 is an official XM Global partnership code that combines instant trading bonuses, deposit bonuses, and an ongoing LOT rebate program to help traders in India increase their capital, reduce trading costs, and build more stable long‑term results. This code is suitable for both beginners and experienced traders who want to maximise all promotions provided by XM in one integrated package.

## Why Use XM Partner Code ELITE10 in India?

By entering **ELITE10** during new account registration, traders in India are directly connected to XM Global's partner network and gain access to several key benefits: a no‑deposit bonus, deposit bonuses up to a certain limit, and daily cashback based on trading volume. None of this changes the default spreads, leverage, or execution speed on XM's platforms.

The IB and affiliate program behind this code is managed by **MonarchForex IB**, an official Introducing Broker focused on education, community support, and rebate management for XM clients in multiple countries, including India. The ELITE10 code links your trading account to the MonarchForex IB system so that all trading volume is properly recorded for bonus and cashback calculation.

## 1. $30 No‑Deposit Bonus

One of the main attractions of ELITE10 is the no‑deposit bonus, which allows traders in India to start testing XM's platform using broker funds instead of their own money. After the new account is fully verified, this bonus is usually credited automatically within a short time and can be used to open real positions in the forex and CFD markets.

This bonus is ideal for:
- New traders who want to experience real market conditions without risking personal capital.
- Experienced traders who want to test new strategies or automated systems in a live environment.

Keep in mind that no‑deposit bonuses generally come with minimum trading volume requirements before profits can be withdrawn, so it is important to review the official terms and conditions.

## 2. 100% Deposit Bonus up to a Certain Limit

On top of the initial bonus, XM Partner Code ELITE10 can activate a 100% deposit bonus up to the maximum amount specified in XM's official promotions. In practice, this means your starting deposit can be multiplied for trading purposes, giving you more room to implement your strategy.

Key practical benefits:
- Stronger account resilience during periods of high volatility.
- More flexibility to diversify strategies and instruments.
- Additional "buffer" for margin, which can support more flexible risk management.

These deposit bonuses are usually used as extra margin rather than withdrawable cash and are subject to specific volume and activity requirements.

## 3. Ongoing LOT Rebate Program for Indian Traders

Unlike one‑off bonuses, LOT rebates are the long‑term core of **ELITE10**. Every time you trade, a portion of the spread or commission paid is returned to you as cashback.

Advantages of this rebate structure:
- Applies to popular instruments such as major forex pairs, XAUUSD (gold), indices, and other CFDs.
- Works well with active styles like scalping, day trading, swing trading, EAs, and copy trading.
- Reduces your effective cost per lot, which is especially valuable for active traders in India.

All rebate tracking and payout calculations under the ELITE10 code are handled by **MonarchForex IB** as an Introducing Broker integrated with XM's internal systems. Their role is to ensure that volume is recorded accurately and that cashback is credited according to schedule.

## 4. Safety, Risk Management, and Balance Protection

XM Global provides features such as negative balance protection and segregated client funds, so losses cannot exceed the amount deposited in the trading account. For traders in India, combining these protections with extra capital from ELITE10 bonuses can create a more forgiving learning environment, as long as sensible risk management is still applied.

Bonuses and rebates are support tools, not substitutes for a proper risk management plan.

## 5. Transparent Costs and Full Ownership of Profit

Using XM Partner Code ELITE10 does not add hidden fees for traders in India. The code itself does not charge extra commission; instead, it unlocks access to bonuses and rebate programs funded by XM's promotional budget and partner revenue share.

Important points:
- You keep 100% of the profits generated from your trading.
- Bonuses and cashback are subject to conditions, but the cost structure is transparent.
- There are no special deductions simply because you used a partner code.
